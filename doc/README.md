## Generated From Source

The framework source code contains detailed information about most of its published data structures, as comments prefixed by `///`.

Our [SynProject tool](https://github.com/synopse/SynProject) was used to extract these description, together with the types and variables definitions themselves, and generate accurate documentation.

## High-Level Documentation

Several chapters of information have also been written as plain text, and included in this folder. It presents high-level definition of the concepts involved in *mORMot*, or low-level presentation of the framework actual implementation.

The documentation source is mainly available in the [mormot2.pro](mormot2.pro) text file.
Our [SynProject tool](https://github.com/synopse/SynProject) is the most convenient way of editing this `mormot2.pro` file content, on Windows.
